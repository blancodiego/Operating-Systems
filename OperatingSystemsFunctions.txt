One function of an operating system is to provide a means for the hardward in a computer to interact with eachother. And operating system interprets the data into readable information the user can read in the form of desktop icons, applications, etc. All the background tasks your operating system provides a means for a user to be able to use.
The operating system coordinates the computer's resources. Without the operating system, software can not interact with the hardware. They are separate and need a means of communication between the two. An operating system provides the means for this and coordinates the computer's resources to the appropriate areas as requested by the software.

In the circumstance requiring a heavy workload on a computer, the operating system would prioritize the computer's tasks according the user's commands and needs. The operating system tells the processor when it needs it to function a certain way for a certain task and when it needs it to stop functioning that way for that task.
